For this project, the first thing we did was get the simple tests passing without the use of the window. We wanted to be able to send one packet at a time successfully and figure out how to detect the different errors. Then we added in the retransmission timeout calculations. Once these things worked we added in a congestion window. We adjusted the previous code we had written to accommodate for multiple packets being sent at a time and went through the different tests to figure out what bugs we needed to fix and what code we needed to make more efficient.
